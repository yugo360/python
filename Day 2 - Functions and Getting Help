# help fuction to see what you are missing = help()

def 
you can build your own function
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
This creates a function called least_difference, which takes three arguments, a, b, and c.
Functions start with a header introduced by the def keyword. The indented block of code following the : is run when the function is called.
return is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a return statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.

docstring = when you call"help() on a function 

sep is to put some value in between 
print(1, 2, 3, sep=' < ')
answ = 1 < 2 < 3
