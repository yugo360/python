a == b	a equal to b		a != b	a not equal to b

def can_run_for_president(age):
    """Can someone of the given age run for president in the US?"""
    # The US Constitution says you must be at least 35 years old
    return age >= 35

You can combine boolean values using the standard concepts of "and", "or", and "not". In fact, the words to do this are: and, or, and not.

1:
Many programming languages have sign available as a built-in function. Python doesn't, but we can define our own!

In the cell below, define a function called sign which takes a numerical argument and returns -1 if it's negative, 1 if it's positive, and 0 if it's 0.

def sign(x):
    if x<0:
        return(-1)
    elif x>0:
        return(1)
    else: 
        return (0)

2:

Modify the definition in the cell below to correct the grammar of our print statement. (If there's only one candy, we should use the singular "candy" instead of the plural "candies")
if total_candies == 1:
    print("Splitting 1 candy")
else:
    print("Splitting", total_candies, "candies")
Here's a slightly more succinct solution using a conditional expression:

print("Splitting", total_candies, "candy" if total_candies == 1 else "candies")
